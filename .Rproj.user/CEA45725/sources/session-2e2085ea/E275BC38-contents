# Sheffield Methods Institute: Custom `xaringan` slide deck

This is a custom slide deck for the Sheffield Methods Institute in University of Sheffield branding. A preview of the slide deck along with some of the more useful but lesser-known features of `xaringan`/`react`'s CSS classes are included. It makes extensive use of `xaringanthemer` and `xaringanExtra` packages. 

This slide deck includes a custom top-only banner header (found in `insert-header.html`), some custom CSS classes to enable independent vertical centering of `.pull-left[]` and `.pull-right[]` style slides, as well as some custom 1/4:3/4 style column splits, text resizing classes.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  url = "https://build-your-own-universe.netlify.app",
  ratio = "16:9"
)
